Hi, welcome to SWObjects and all that. You probably want to:
  Edit CONFIG to change which libs you link to.
  If you're using MacOS or non debian linux, edit the Makefile 
    to select the appropriate echo (e.g. ECHO:=`which echo`).
    There is some guidance in Makefile:33
  make test

This should all be made easier when ./configure is finished.

# Debian instructions

you'll need these packages:

- flex
- bison
- zlib1g-dev
- libmd-dev
- uuid-dev
- libcrypto++6
- libexpat1-dev
- libmysqlclient-dev
- libboost-dev
- libboost-log-dev
- libboost-regex-dev
- libboost-test-dev
- libboost-program-options-dev
